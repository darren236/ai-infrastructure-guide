# Guide 02 — Adapting NVIDIA Nemotron 3.5 Streaming ASR to Singapore English

## Goal and scope

Build a small proof of concept (POC) and tutorial for adapting streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) to Singapore English. The goal is a manageable learning exercise, not production-quality tuning. Model loading, dataset preparation, training, and evaluation results will be documented only after they are performed.

## Node preflight — complete

**Milestone recorded:** 2026-10-05, the documentation sync date. The following checks were performed on the GPU node before pulling the NeMo container or downloading the model/data. Evidence is the operator's sanitized summary.

```bash
df -h
free -h
nvidia-smi
```

| Resource or check | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| Root filesystem total | 267 GB, as reported in the milestone summary |
| Root filesystem used | 53 GB |
| Root filesystem available | 214 GB |
| Host RAM total | 15 GiB |
| Host RAM available | Approximately 14 GiB |
| Swap | None configured |
| GPU | NVIDIA L4 |
| GPU VRAM total / used | 23,034 MiB / 0 MiB |
| GPU utilization | 0% |
| NVIDIA driver | `595.91.07` |
| Driver-reported CUDA compatibility level | `13.2` |
| Running GPU processes | None reported |

Disk figures preserve the operator's reported units and rounded values; GNU `df -h` uses powers of 1024 for human-readable sizes. This is one preflight snapshot, not a measurement under model or training load.

### What the checks establish

- `df -h` checks filesystem capacity and usage; `-h` formats sizes in human-readable units. Check the filesystem where downloads and container storage will live. See the [GNU df manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/df-invocation.html).
- `free -h` checks CPU/system RAM and swap, separately from GPU VRAM. Linux uses otherwise unused RAM for filesystem cache, so low `free` memory can coexist with high `available` memory. `available` estimates memory usable by new applications without swapping, accounting for reclaimable cache. See the [free manual](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/free.1.html).
- `nvidia-smi` checks GPU/driver communication and reports GPU memory, utilization, thermals, power, and active processes. No temperature or power reading was supplied for this milestone. The reported CUDA compatibility level does not establish an installed host Toolkit version. See [NVIDIA's nvidia-smi documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvidia-smi/index.html).

Preflight checks help rule out simple causes such as disk exhaustion, current host-memory pressure, or an already-occupied GPU before investigating model/container issues. This snapshot showed available disk and RAM and an idle GPU; it does not yet establish resource sufficiency for the selected model, data, or training configuration.

## Completion boundaries and next step

| Guide 02 stage | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Node resource preflight | Complete |
| NeMo container validation | Not yet complete |
| Model download and loading | Not yet complete |
| Dataset download and preparation | Not yet complete |
| Training / adaptation | Not yet complete |
| Evaluation | Not yet complete |

Next, select and validate the NeMo container for this small POC, then proceed to model loading and dataset preparation. No container, model, dataset, training, or evaluation success is claimed by this milestone.
